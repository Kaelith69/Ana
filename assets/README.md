# Demo Assets

Place your demo GIF here: `assets/demo.gif`

## Suggested GIF Content

The demo GIF should show one or more of:

- Ana responding to a trigger word in a Discord channel (e.g., sending "hello" and getting an AI reply)
- The `!joke` command being used and Ana returning a dad joke
- Terminal/console output showing the AI pipeline logging (GROQ Output, fallback chain firing)
- The bot coming online (the "Logged in as Ana" startup message)

## How to Record

**Discord UI demo:**
- Use [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) (Windows/macOS) or [Peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) (Linux) to record a GIF
- Keep it short — 5-10 seconds is ideal
- Crop to just the Discord window or terminal
- Aim for < 5MB file size

**Terminal demo:**
- [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) + [agg](https://github.com/asciinema/agg) for terminal recordings converted to GIF
- Shows the startup sequence and log output nicely

## After Recording

Save as `assets/demo.gif` and the README will display it automatically.
